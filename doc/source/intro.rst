Introduction
============
Squealy is a django app for auto-generating reporting APIs. All configurations are passed through a single **.yml** file, which includes sql queries to fetch report data for each API.

There is support for auto-formatting the data to google charts and highcharts format for quick dashboard integration.

Squealy also supports sql templates based on `jinjasql <https://github.com/hashedin/jinjasql>`_, hence, complex parameterized sql queries can be written.

Squealy-generated APIs are based on `Django Rest Framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_. All APIs can be easily configured to use the authentication classes provided by django rest framework.

Squealy supports parameter level and API level validation/authorization as well.

Squealy is highly customizable.
